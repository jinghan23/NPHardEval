So, we discard the left half of the array and continue our search in the right half of the array. The right half of the array has two elements: 11 and 18. The middle element is 11. Since 11 is less than 19, we discard the right half of the array and continue our search in the left half of the sub-array. The left half of the sub-array has only one element: 11. This is the target value, so the search ends here.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '2'}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\n\n### 2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2", "correctness": [false, "The target index is incorrect."]}, {"output": "<root>\n<reasoning>\nThe array is sorted and we are looking for the target value 6.

If you subtract the third equation from the second, you get $x+y+z=0$. So, you have $x+y+z=0$ and $x+y+z=0$. \u2013\u00a0Clarinetist Feb 11 '17 at 14:05\n\u2022 @user401445 I've edited my answer to make it more clear. \u2013\u00a0Clarinetist Feb 11 '17 at 14:06\n\u2022 @user401445 I've edited my answer to make it more clear. \u2013\u00a0Clarinetist Feb 11 '17 at 14:07\n\u2022 @user401445 I've edited my answer to make", "correctness": [true, "The solution is valid."]}, {"output": "<root>\n<reasoning>\nThe array is sorted, so we can use binary search.

I want to find the number of solutions of this system.\n\n$$\\begin{cases} 2x+y+z=1 \\\\ x+2y+z=1 \\\\ x+y+2z=1 \\end{cases}$$\n\nI know that the number of solutions is 0, but I don't know how to prove it.\n\n\u2022 Hint: subtract the second equation from the first, and the third from the second. \u2013\u00a0lulu Feb 11 '17 at 13:59\n\u2022 @lulu I did that, but I don't know what to do next. \u2013\u00a0user401445 Feb 11 '17 at 14:00\n\u2022 Well, what do you get? \u2013\u00a0lulu Feb 11 '17 at 14:00\n\u2022 @lulu I get 0=0. \u2013\u00a0user401445 Feb 11 '17 at 14:01\n\u2022 @lulu I'm sorry, I don't know what to do next. \u2013\u00a0user401445 Feb 11 '17 at 14:02\n\n## 2 Answers\n\nYou can subtract the second equation from the first and the third from the second to get $$(2-1)x+(1-2)y+(1-1)z=1-1\\\\ (1-2)x+(2-1)y+(1-1)z=1-1\\\\ (1-1)x+(1-2)y+(2-1)z=1-1$$ which simplifies to $$x-y=0\\\\ -x+y=0\\\\ y-z=0$$\n\nNow, you can see that the first and second equations are the same, and the second and third equations are the same. So, you have two equations that are the same, and you can solve for $y$ in the first equation. Then, you can plug that value of $y$ into the second equation to solve for $x$. Then, you can plug those values of $x$ and $y$ into the third equation to solve for $z$.\n\n\u2022 I got x=y=z=1. Is that correct? \u2013\u00a0user401445 Feb 11 '17 at 14:07\n\u2022 @user401445 Yes, that is correct. \u2013\u00a0Noble Mushtak Feb 11 '17 at 14:08\n\u2022 @NobleMushtak I'm sorry, but I don't understand how you got x=y=z=1. \u2013\u00a0user401445 Feb 11 '17 at 14:10\n\u2022 @user401445 I edited my answer to explain how to get $x=y=z=1$. \u2013\u00a0Noble Mushtak Feb 11 '17 at 14:11\n\u2022 @NobleMushtak Thank you very much! \u2013\u00a0user401445 Feb 11 '17 at 14:12\n\nHint:\n\n$$2x+y+z=1$$ $$x+2", "correctness": [true, "The solution is valid."]}, {"output": "<root>\n<reasoning>\nThe array is sorted, so we can use binary search.

Step 1: Understand the Problem\u00b6\n\n\u2022 The problem is to find the position of the target value 15 in the sorted array. The index begins with 0. The array elements are provided.\n\n\u2022 Follow the format in the above examples to write your answer.\n\n#### 2.2.2.2.2. Step 2: Devise a Plan\u00b6\n\n\u2022 The array is sorted and has 11 elements. We start by checking the middle element at index 5, which is 21. Since 15 is less than 21, we discard the second half of the array and repeat the process for the first half. The new middle element is at index 2, which is 8. Since 15 is greater than 8, we discard the first half of the array and repeat the process for the second half. The new middle element is at index 3, which is 15. Since 15 is equal to 15, we have found the target value at index 3.\n\n#### 2.2.2.2.3. Step 3: Carry out the Plan\u00b6\n\n\u2022 The array is sorted and has 11 elements. The middle index of the array is 5 (11/2). The element at index 5 is 21, which is less than the target value 15. Therefore, we can ignore the first half of the array and only consider the second half. The second half of the array is: 21, 23, 28, 30, 32, 35, 48. The middle index of this sub-array is 2 (5/2). The element at index 2 is 23, which is less than the target value 15. Therefore, we can ignore the first half of this sub-array and only consider the second half. The second half of this sub-array is: 28, 30, 32, 35, 48. The middle index of this sub-array is 2 (2/2). The element at index 2 is 30, which is less than the target value 15. Therefore, we can ignore the first half of this sub-array and only consider the second half. The second half of this sub-array is: 32, 35, 48. The middle index of this sub-array is 0 (2/2). The element at index 0 is 32, which is greater than the target value 15. Therefore, we can ignore the second half of this sub-array and only consider the first half. The first half of this sub-array is: 32. The middle index of this sub-array is 0 (1/2). The element at index 0 is 32, which is equal to the target value. Therefore, the position of the target value 15 in the original array is 3 (5 + 2 + 0).\n\n#### 2.2.2.2.4. Step 4: Write the Code\u00b6\n\n\u2022 The array is sorted and has 11 elements.
