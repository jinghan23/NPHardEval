We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell can be calculated based on the values of its neighboring cells. If the i-th character of the first string is the same as the j-th character of the second string, the value of the cell is the same as the value of the cell diagonally above and to the left. Otherwise, it is one more than the minimum of the values of the cell to the left, the cell above, and the cell diagonally above and to the left. The minimum number of operations required to transform the first string into the second string is the value of the cell at the bottom right corner of the matrix.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Operations': 12}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the minimum number of operations required to transform the first string \"wpljmomdecwg\" into the second string \"mhdoexqioqix\".
