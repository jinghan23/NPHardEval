We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell can be calculated as the minimum of the values of the cell above it plus 1 (representing a deletion), the cell to its left plus 1 (representing an insertion), and the cell diagonally above and to the left plus the cost of a substitution (which is 0 if the corresponding characters in the two strings are the same and 1 otherwise).

We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell can be calculated based on the values of its neighboring cells. If the i-th character of the first string is the same as the j-th character of the second string, the value of the cell is the same as the value of the cell diagonally above and to the left.
