We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell can be calculated as the minimum of the values of the cell above it plus 1 (representing a deletion), the cell to its left plus 1 (representing an insertion), and the cell diagonally above and to the left plus the cost of a substitution (which is 0 if the corresponding characters in the two strings are the same and 1 otherwise).

We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell can be calculated based on the values of its neighboring cells. If the i-th character of the first string is the same as the j-th character of the second string, the value of the cell is the same as the value of the cell diagonally above and to the left. Otherwise, it is one more than the minimum of the values of the cell to the left, the cell above, and the cell diagonally above and to the left.
