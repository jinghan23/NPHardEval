We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The first row and the first column are initialized to represent the number of operations required to transform an empty string into the first i characters of the first and second strings, respectively. Then, for each cell, we consider three possibilities: inserting a character (which corresponds to moving one cell to the right), deleting a character (which corresponds to moving one cell down), and substituting a character (which corresponds to moving one cell diagonally). The value of the cell is the minimum of these three possibilities. The minimum number of operations required to transform the first string into the second string is the value of the cell at the last row and last column.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Operations': 4}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the minimum number of operations required to transform the first string \"fbhja\" into the second string \"ciafh\".

The value of each cell can be calculated based on the values of its neighboring cells. If the i-th character of the first string is the same as the j-th character of the second string, the value of the cell is the same as the value of the cell diagonally above and to the left. Otherwise, it is one more than the minimum of the values of the cell to the left, the cell above, and the cell diagonally above and to the left.
