We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the position. If the target value is less than the middle element, we continue the search on the left half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we continue the search on the right half of the array. We repeat this process until we find the target value or the search space is empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this problem:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 26. The target value 20 is less than 26, so we continue the search on the left half of the array.\n\n2.
