The binary search algorithm starts by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. \nStep 1: The middle element is the second one, which is 2. The target value 15 is greater than 2, so the search continues on the right half of the array.\nStep 2: Now, the right half of the array has two elements: 3 and 15. The middle element is 3. The target value 15 is greater than 3, so the search continues on the right half of this sub-array.\nStep 3: Now, the right half of the sub-array has only one element: 15.

The middle element of this subarray is 0 (at index 0). The target value 23 is less than 0, so we continue the search on the left half of the subarray.\n\n15. The left half", "correctness": [false, "The solution is invalid."]}, {"output": "<root>\n<reasoning>\nThe binary search algorithm works by dividing the search space in half at each step. We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the target. If the target value is less than the middle element, we continue the search on the left half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we continue the search on the right half of the array. We repeat this process until we find the target or until the search space is empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this problem:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 33 (at index 10). The target value 46 is greater than 33, so we continue the search on the right half of the array.\n\n2. The right half of the array is [40, 40, 46, 56]. The middle element of this subarray is 40 (at index 11). The target value 46 is less than 40, so we continue the search on the left half of the subarray.\n\n3. The left half of the subarray is [40, 46]. The middle element of this subarray is 40 (at index 11). The target value 46 is less than 40, so we continue the search on the left half of the subarray.\n\n4. The left half of the subarray is [46]. The middle element of this subarray is 46 (at index 11). The target value 46 is equal to 46, so we have found the target.\n\nThe position of the target value 46 in the array is 11.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '11'}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the position of the target value 47 in the sorted array.
