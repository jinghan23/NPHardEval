We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the position. If the target value is less than the middle element, we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we discard the left half of the array and repeat the process with the right half. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this array:\n\n1. The middle element of the array [1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] is 6. Since 10 is less than 6, we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half [10].\n2. The new array is 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The middle element is 12. The target value 10 is less than 12, so we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half [10].\n3. The new array is 10. The middle element is 10, which is equal to the target value.
