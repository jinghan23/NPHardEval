The steps are as follows:\n1. Find the middle element of the array. The array has 6 elements, so the middle element is at index 3 (20).\n2. The target value (10) is less than the middle element (20), so we discard the second half of the array and repeat the process with the first half.\n3. Now the array is [10, 11, 13]. The middle element is at index 1 (11).\n4. The target value (10) is less than the middle element (11), so we discard the second half of the array and repeat the process with the first half.\n5. Now the array is [10]. The middle element is at index 0 (10).\n6.

We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the target. If the target value is less than the middle element, we continue the search on the left half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we continue the search on the right half of the array.

The middle element of the array [6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 30] is 13.\n2. The target value 30 is greater than 13, so we continue the search on the right half of the array [14, 30].\n3.
