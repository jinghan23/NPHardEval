We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the position. If the target value is less than the middle element, we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we discard the left half of the array and repeat the process with the right half.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this array:\n\n1. The middle element of the array [1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 20, 24, 36, 45] is 10.
