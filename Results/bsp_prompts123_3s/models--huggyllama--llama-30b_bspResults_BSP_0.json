Include your search process in <reasoning></reasoning> tags and the final position of the target value in <final_answer></final_answer> tags, like <final_answer>{'Position': 'TARGET_POSITION'}</final_answer>. \nAnswer:\n<root>\n<reasoning>\nThe array is sorted, so we can use binary search to find the target value. \n1. First, we find the middle element of the array. The array has 12 elements, so the middle element is at index ", "correctness": [true, "The solution is valid."]}, {"output": "<root>\n<reasoning>\nThe array is sorted, so we can use binary search to find the target value. \n1. First, we find the middle element of the array. The array has 12 elements, so the middle element is at index 6 (0-based index). The value at index 6 is 40, which is greater than the target value 46.\n2. Since the target value is less than the middle element, we discard the second half of the array and repeat the process for the first half.\n3.
