Since the array is sorted, we can determine which half of the array our target value is in by comparing it to the middle element. \n\nHere are the steps of the search process:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 10. Since 12 is less than 10, we know that if 12 is in the array, it must be in the first half. \n\n2. We then look at the middle element of the first half of the array, which is 1. Again, 12 is less than 1, so if 12 is in the array, it must be in the first half of the first half. \n\n3.
