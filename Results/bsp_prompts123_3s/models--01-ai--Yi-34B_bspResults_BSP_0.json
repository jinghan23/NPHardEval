Since the target value is greater than the middle element, we discard the first half of the array and repeat the process for the second half.\n3. The second half of the array is [33, 40, 40, 46, 56]. The middle element of this sub-array is at index 2 (0-based index). The value at index 2 is 40, which is less than the target value 46.\n4. Since the target value is greater than the middle element, we discard the first half of the sub-array and repeat the process for the second half.\n5. The second half of the sub-array is [40, 46, 56]. The middle element of this sub-array is at index 1 (0-based index). The value at index 1 is 46, which is equal to the target value.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '7'}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the position of the target value 10 in the sorted array.
