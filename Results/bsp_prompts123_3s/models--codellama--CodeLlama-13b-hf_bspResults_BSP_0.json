If the target value is greater than the middle element, we discard the left half of the array and repeat the process with the right half. \n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this array:\n\n1. The middle element of the array [2, 5, 20, 20, 26, 30, 32, 42, 48, 50] is 20. Since 5 is less than 20, we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half [2, 5, 20, 20].\n2. The middle element of the array [2, 5, 20, 20] is 20. Since 5 is less than 20, we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half [2, 5, 20].\n3. The middle element of the array [2, 5, 20] is 5, which is equal to the target value.
