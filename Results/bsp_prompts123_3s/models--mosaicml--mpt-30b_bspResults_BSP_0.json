We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the target. If the target value is less than the middle element, we continue the search on the left half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we continue the search on the right half of the array. We repeat this process until we find the target or until the search space is empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this problem:\n\n1. The middle element of the array [6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 30] is 13.\n2. The target value 30 is greater than 13, so we continue the search on the right half of the array [14, 30].\n3. The middle element of the array [14, 30] is 14.\n4. The target value 30 is greater than 14, so we continue the search on the right half of the array [30].\n5. The middle element of the array [30] is 30, which is equal to the target value. So, we have found the target.\n\nThe position of the target value 30 in the array is 5.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '5'}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the position of the target value 7 in the sorted array.

We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. The middle element is 9. Since 7 is less than 9, we know that if 7 is present in the array, it must be in the first half. We then look at the first half of the array, which is [7, 8, 9]. The middle element here is 8. Again, since 7 is less than 8, we know that if 7 is present, it must be in the first half of this sub-array. The first half of this sub-array is [7], and 7 is the target value we are looking for.

If the target value is less than the middle element, we discard the right half of the array and repeat the process with the left half. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we discard the left half of the array and repeat the process with the right half. We repeat this process until we find the target value or the search space is empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this problem:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 8. Since 33 is greater than 8, we discard the left half of the array and repeat the process with the right half [15, 19, 33, 45, 49].\n2. The middle element of the array is 19. Since 33 is greater than 19, we discard the left half of the array and repeat the process with the right half [33, 45, 49].\n3. The middle element of the array is 33.
