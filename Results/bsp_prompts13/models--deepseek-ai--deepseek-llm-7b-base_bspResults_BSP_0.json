If the target value is less than the middle element, we continue the search on the left half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we continue the search on the right half of the array. We repeat this process until we find the target or until the search space is empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this problem:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 29 (at index 6). The target value 23 is less than 29, so we continue the search on the left half of the array.\n\n2. The left half of the array is [10, 21, 21, 22, 23, 29]. The middle element of this subarray is 21 (at index 4). The target value 23 is less than 21, so we continue the search on the left half of the subarray.\n\n3. The left half of the subarray is [10, 21]. The middle element of this subarray is 10 (at index 0). The target value 23 is less than 10, so we continue the search on the left half of the subarray.\n\n4. The left half of the subarray is [10]. The middle element of this subarray is 10 (at index 0). The target value 23 is equal to 10, so we have found the target.\n\nThe position of the target value 23 in the array is 0.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '0'}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the position of the target value 10 in the sorted array.

We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the target.
