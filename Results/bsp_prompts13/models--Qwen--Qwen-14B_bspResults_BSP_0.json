We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If the target value is equal to the middle element, we have found the target. If the target value is less than the middle element, we continue the search on the left half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, we continue the search on the right half of the array. We repeat this process until we find the target or until the search space is empty.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for this problem:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 33 (at index 6). The target value 46 is greater than 33, so we continue the search on the right half of the array.\n\n2. The right half of the array is [46, 56]. The middle element of this subarray is 46 (at index 1. The target value 46 is equal to 46, so we have found the target.\n\nThe position of the target value 46 in the array is 1.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Position': '1'}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the position of the target value 46 in the sorted array.
