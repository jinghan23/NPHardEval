The target value is 8. We start the binary search by checking the middle element of the array. Since the array has an even number of elements, we consider the lower middle as the middle element. The middle element is at index 1 and its value is 9. Since 9 is greater than 8, we discard the second half of the array and continue our search in the first half. The first half of the array has only one element which is 8 and it matches our target value.

We start by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. The middle element is 9. Since 5 is less than 9, we know that if 5 is present in the array, it must be in the first half. We then look at the first half of the array, which is [4, 5, 5, 15, 21, 21, 25]. The middle element here is 5. Since 5 is less than 5, we know that if 5 is present, it must be in the first half of this sub-array. The first half of this sub-array is [4, 5], and 5 is the target value we are looking for.

Since the array is sorted, we can determine which half of the array our target value is in by comparing it to the middle element. \n\nHere are the steps of the search process:\n\n1. The middle element of the array is 11. Since 35 is greater than 11, we know that if 35 is in the array, it must be in the second half. \n\n2. We then look at the middle element of the second half of the array, which is 22.

The steps are as follows:\n1. Find the middle element of the array. The array has 8 elements, so the middle element is at index 4 (18).\n2. The target value 7 is less than 18, so we discard the second half of the array and repeat the process with the first half.\n3. The first half of the array is [7, 12]. The middle element is at index 1 (12).\n4. The target value 7 is less than 12, so we discard the second half of the sub-array and repeat the process with the first half.\n5. The first half of the sub-array is [7]. The middle element is at index 0 (7).\n6.
