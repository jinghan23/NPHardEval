We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell is calculated as the minimum of the values of the cell above it plus 1 (representing a deletion), the cell to its left plus 1 (representing an insertion), and the cell diagonally above and to the left plus the cost of a substitution (which is 0 if the characters are the same and 1 otherwise).
