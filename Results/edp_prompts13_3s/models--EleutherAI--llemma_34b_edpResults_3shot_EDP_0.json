We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell is calculated as the minimum of the values of the cell above it plus 1 (representing a deletion), the cell to its left plus 1 (representing an insertion), and the cell diagonally above and to the left plus the cost of a substitution (which is 0 if the characters are the same and 1 otherwise).

The operations are as follows:\n- If the characters at the current position in both strings are the same, we don't need to perform any operation, so we take the value from the previous row and column.\n- If the characters are different, we take the minimum value from the previous row, previous column, and previous row and column, and add 1 to it.

The minimum number of operations required to transform the first string into the second string is the value of the cell at the bottom right corner of the matrix.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Operations': 11}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the minimum number of operations required to transform the first string \"xbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbxbx", "correctness": [false, "The reported edit distance (11) is incorrect.
