We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value of each cell can be calculated as the minimum of the values of the cell above it (representing a deletion), the cell to its left (representing an insertion), and the cell diagonally above and to the left (representing a substitution or no operation, depending on whether the characters at the current positions in the two strings are the same or not). The value at the bottom right corner of the matrix represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the entire first string into the entire second string.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>{'Operations': 12}</final_answer>\n</root>\n\nQuestion: Find the minimum number of operations required to transform the first string \"kunqkdjrdalq\" into the second string \"eobhhpruehahar\".
