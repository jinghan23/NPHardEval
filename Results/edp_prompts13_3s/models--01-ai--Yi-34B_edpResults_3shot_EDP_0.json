We create a matrix where the cell at the i-th row and j-th column represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the first i characters of the first string into the first j characters of the second string. The value at the last cell of the matrix represents the minimum number of operations required to transform the entire first string into the second string. The operations are as follows:\n- If the characters at the current position in both strings are the same, we don't need to perform any operation, so we take the value from the previous row and column.\n- If the characters are different, we take the minimum value from the previous row, previous column, and previous row and column, and add 1 to it.
