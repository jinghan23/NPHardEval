This algorithm works by finding augmenting paths (paths from the source to the sink where the flow is less than the capacity) and increasing the flow along these paths until no more augmenting paths can be found. However, without the complete network graph, it's impossible to apply this algorithm and find the maximum flow and the flow for each edge. The information provided only includes the capacities of the edges, but not how they are connected, which is crucial for solving the problem.\n</reasoning>\n<final_answer>\n{'MaxFlow': 'N/A', 'Flows': {'7->9': 'N/A', '8->14': 'N/A', '3->11': 'N/A', '11->12': 'N/A', '4->9': 'N/A', '7->11': 'N/A', '9->11': 'N/A', '7->9': 'N/A', '12->13': 'N/A', '2->5': 'N/A', '5->8': 'N/A', '12->14': 'N/A', '2->4': 'N/A', '11->14': 'N/A', '4->9': 'N/A', '0->1': 'N/A', '13->14': 'N/A'}}\n</final_answer>",

This algorithm works by repeatedly augmenting the flow along an augmenting path from the source to the sink in the residual graph. The residual graph is a graph which shows the additional possible flow. If there is a path from the source 's' to the sink 't' in the residual graph, then there is some flow which can be pushed forward. The algorithm is repeated until no more augmenting paths can be found.\n\nHowever, without the actual graph or a description of the connections between nodes, it's impossible to apply the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm or any other method to find the maximum flow. The capacities of the edges alone are not enough to solve the problem. We need to know how the nodes are connected by these edges.\n</reasoning>\n\n<final_answer>\n{'MaxFlow': 'N/A', 'Flows': {'9->17': 'N/A', '4->5': 'N/A', '8->16': 'N/A', '4->7': 'N/A', '16->18': 'N/A', '13->15': 'N/A', '5->10': 'N/A', '8->18': 'N/A', '2->12': 'N/A', '7->9': 'N/A', '6->13': 'N/A', '5->18': 'N/A', '13->14': 'N/A', '11->12': 'N/A', '15->16': 'N/A', '4->9': 'N/A', '7->8': 'N/A', '10->13': 'N/A', '8->9': 'N/A', '5->6': 'N/A', '8->13': 'N/A'}}\n</final_answer>",

Additionally, the capacities of the edges are provided, but the network's structure or the connections between the nodes are not specified. \n\nTo solve a maximum flow problem, we need a complete description of the network, including all nodes, all edges, and the capacity of each edge.
